\section{Hypothesis}

Due to the fact that our report deals with such a broad scope, we can not answer our initiating problem in such a short time. Therefore a hypothesis is used to measure the success of our project. 

The solution to the initiating problem implemented in this project, will make it harder for thieves to remove bikes from bicycle sheds due to inefficient locking by their owners. The solution in place will use RFID-based cards to lock their bicycles to the rack to reduce time spent on parking and reducing the stress level by preventing bicycle theft.
