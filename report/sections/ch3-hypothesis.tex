\section{Hypothesis}

Due to the fact that our report deals with such a broad scope, we can not completely cover our initiating problem in such a short time. Therefore, a hypothesis is used to measure the success of our project. 

The solution to the initiating problem discussed in this project, is to make a rover capable of 2D mapping of unknown terrains and finding its own path to navigate across it. Then provide a usable 2D map of the surroundings from point A to B. The rover should also be capable of implementing equipment for 3D mapping in the future.
