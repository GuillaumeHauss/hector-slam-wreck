\section{Hypothesis}

Due to the fact that our report deals with such a broad scope, we can not completely cover our initiating problem in such a short time. Therefore a hypothesis is used to measure the success of our project. 

The solution to the initiating problem implemented in this project, will make a rover capable of 2D mapping an unknown terrain and be able to find its own path and navigate across it. Then provide a usable 2D map of its surroundings from point A to B. The rover should also be capable of implementing equipment for 3D mapping.
