\section{Health and Safety analysis}

%Implementing an electrical solution into a bicycle shed can pose a threat when it comes to electrical wires. It is important that the different weather conditions are kept in mind when dealing with outdoor electrical circuits, where there might 14 Chapter 2. Problem Analysis be harmful or potentially lethal electrical conditions. Rainy weather, heavy fog and general moisture are some of the weather conditions that pose a safety threat towards our electrical circuits. All of the materials mentioned in the previous section, that were examined from an environmental standpoint, does not have any direct health concerns towards end users. For example, ABS plastic is only hazardous when heated up during production, as it may produce fumes of acrylonitrile, that is acutely toxic and highly flammable [19].
