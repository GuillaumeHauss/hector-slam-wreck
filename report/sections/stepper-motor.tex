Stepper motors are electrical motors that can be precisely controlled.
It divides a full rotation into a discrete amount of steps, each equally big.

Stepper motors are usually used with a specific circuit to control them, a stepper-motor controller.

The stepper motor we used in our project is NEMA-17 Bipolar Stepper Motor.
Step: 1.8deg

The stepper motor controller we used is an EasyDriver
