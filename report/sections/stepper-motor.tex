Stepper motors are electrical motors that can be precisely controlled.
It divides a full rotation into a discrete amount of steps, each equally big.

Stepper motors are usually used with a specific circuit to control them, a stepper-motor controller.

The stepper motor we used in our project is NEMA-17 Bipolar Stepper Motor.
Step: 1.8deg

The stepper motor controller we used is an EasyDriver

Since the stepper motor we use divides a full cycle into 200 steps, this means that the maximum resulustion possible is 1.8 degrees. At a dictance of 1m, 1.8degrees can resolve a distance of ~3.1cm, and this increases linearly with a larger distance.

$\frac{x}{sin(1.8deg)} = \frac{1m}{sin(89.1deg)}$
$x = \frac{sin(1.8deg)}{sin(89.1deg)}m$
$x = 3.14cm$
