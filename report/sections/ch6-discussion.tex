During the initial stages of the project the goal was that we developed an autonomous mapping vehicle. Unfortunately gathering the data and creating a map using SLAM proved to be much harder than first anticipated. 
We decided early on that ROS would be the most optimal choice for our main operating system, as it seem well documented and easy to use. People had previously used a Raspberry Pi and ROS to produce maps of different environments using SLAM.

Within a few days of working with the Lidar we managed to get some solid distance readings from the device.
Though from the start we experienced many issues just getting ROS to run on the Raspberry Pi, this set us back quite a bit.
