\section{Requirements}

This section outlines the requirements for both the prototype that we are aiming to achieve through this project, and the requirements for testing and evaluating it.

\subsection{Prototype}

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item The rover should be remotely controlled.
	\item The rover should be autonomous.
	\item From the laser sensor we can make a 2D map of the surroundings.
	\item Running a Raspberry Pi that controlled mapping and navigation at the same time.
	\item The system should include a laser sensor.
	\item The system should include a ultra-sonic sensor.
 	\item The prototype should be capable of implementing an 3D mapping sensor without much change.
	
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Testing}

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item The rover can be controlled using a remote.
	\item The rover should navigate autonomous through a maze.
	\item The laser sensor should make a usable 2D map of it's surroundings.
	
\end{enumerate}

These criteria will be used to design, implement and test our implementation of the prototype later on. These requirements will be re-evaluated in the Discussion section.
