\section{Laser}

A SoC (System-on-a-Chip) solution for optical distance measurements applications. The PulsedLight LIDAR has a 4.7 - 5.5 V nominal and 6 V potentially maximum DC operating range. The sensor has a theoretical limit of 40m range and 100Hz rep rate. The laser emitters' accuracy is estimated to be +/- 2.5cm with an aquisition time of less then 0.02sec. These specifications allows us to get an accurate image of the environments specified in our test cases.
%TODO: Specify testing environments in the testsing section.

%How the laser works

At distances less than a meter, the beam is about the size of the lens, at distances longer than that you can estimate it using this equation: 
\\ d/100 = bsize \\
where d = distance and bsize = the beam size at that specific distance, in whatever units you measured it in. The actual spread is ~8 milli-radians or ~1/2 degree.

The assembling of the laser happened in the following way:

We started using a library called lidarLite, which provides a simple C interface to the LIDAR on a Raspberry. It is based on the WiringPi interface, which is a GPIO access library written in C for the BCM2835 SoC used in the Raspberry Pi. It is usable from C and C++ and many other languages with suitable wrappers. It was designed very familiarly to Arduino's wiring library.

With the lidarLite library, we managed to set up a connection using the I2C protocol. By enabling the built in I2C support in the Raspberry Pi kernel, and after the wiring of the components, a connection has been set up between the LIDAR laser and the controller.

A small program was written in order to test the output of the laser sensor, namely to read out the distance value of the next closest point in centimeters. 

% sample output here

This output is generated by the function called \textit{lidar\_read(int fd)} from the lidarLite library. This code simply calculates the low and high value from the sensor and returns the distance measurements in centimeters, in form of an integer value. The guide on how to compile and run this small test application is available in the Appendix \\ %TODO: Add readme.md from laser-module folder to appendix.

We then tried to incorporate this code with a stepper-motor, so that it would return the distances around a circle.

The first version had the stepper-motor spinning the laser around at a constant speed, driven by an arduino(reference to code here), while the laser made measurements, driven by the Pi.

In order to determine how long it takes for the lidarLite lidar\_read function to execute, some testing was made

%asd.cpp

This code was run with the settings of 1000 and 2000, each version was run 3 times.

%TODO: format data nicely
Measurements of how long it takes to run lidar\_read
1000: 24.372s,24.476s,24.490s;avg:24.446s
2000: 48.400s,48.111s,48.172s;avg:48.228s

According to this data we can isolate the time it takes to execute the lidar\_read function from everything else:

$t_{total} = n*t_{lidar} + t_{rest}$

$24.446s = 1000*t_{lidar} + t_{rest}$
$48.228s = 2000*t_{lidar} + t_{rest}$
Subtract the two equations
$23.782s = 1000*t_{lidar}$
$t_{lidar} = 0.023782s \approx 0.024s$


This proved ineffective, since the rotation and measurements were independent of eachother, which caused the measurements to be skewed over time.

Then we attempted to controll the stepper-motor with the Pi, in the same code as we were running the laser. However, the wiringPi library required root privileges, and ROS cannot be run with root privileges easily. The solution was to use a system call library to call some external code which would drive the stepper-motor. This makes the stepping and measuring synchronous, but making system call is very expensive, meaning the code is significantly slower that the top speed of the laser.

\lstinputlisting[firstline=1, lastline=16, title=gpioWrapper, language=shell]{../code/gpiothing.sh}
The only purpose of this code is to be called from the main file. The gpio utility is capable of interfacing with the GPIO pins on the Pi without root privileges. The change from low to high causes a micro-step, and 8 micro-steps make one full step.
