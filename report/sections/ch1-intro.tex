We started out the project with a brainstorming session where we discussed different problems we would like to solve. By the end of the session, we came up with the following list of problems:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Noise pollution
	\item Navigation using echolocation
	\item Re-usability of heat waste
	\item Mapping of unknown terrains without any external technologies
	\item Maze navigation
\end{itemize}

We could identify a common theme amongst these problems, which led us to the conclusion that the problem-domain should be within mapping and navigation.

Furthermore we decided to expand upon the problem-domain we set for ourselves and to further explore it. This led to more discussions on possible outcomes, implementations and benefits of such system.

\end{figure}

In this flowchart you can see the different approaches we can take to map different unknown terrains.

We decided to continue on with the selected problem-domain and started using a W-diagram model to expand upon it further and to identify the parts needed to be researched. This method will help us to come up with a solution to the problem at hand.
