We started out the project with a brainstorming session where we discussed different problems we would like to solve. By the end of the session, we came up with the following list of problems:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Noise pollution
	\item Navigation using echolocation
	\item Re-usability of heat waste
	\item Mapping unknown terrains without any external technologies
	\item Maze navigation
\end{itemize}

We could identify a common theme amongst these problems, which led us to the conclusion that the problem domain should be within mapping and navigations.

Furthermore we decided to cut down and expand upon the problem-domain we set for ourselves.
This led to more discussions on possible outcomes, uses and benefits of such system.

We decided to go on with the problem domain and started using a W-diagram to expand upon it further and identify the parts needed to be researched to come up with a solution.
