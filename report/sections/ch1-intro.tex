We started out the project with a brainstorming session where we discussed different problems we would like to solve. By the end of the session, we came up with the following list of problems:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Noise pollution
	\item Navigation using echolocation
	\item Re-usability of heat waste
	\item Mapping of unknown terrains without any external technologies
	\item Maze navigation
\end{itemize}

We could identify a common theme amongst these problems, which led us to the conclusion that the problem-domain should be within mapping and navigation.

Furthermore we decided to expand upon the problem-domain we set for ourselves and to further explore it. This led to more discussions on possible outcomes, implementations and benefits of such system.

We decided to continue on with the selected problem-domain and started using a W-diagram model to expand upon it further and to identify the parts needed to be researched. This method will help us to come up with a solution to the problem at hand.
