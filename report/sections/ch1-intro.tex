%TODO: General intro here 
We started out the project with a brainstorming session where we discussed different problems we would like to solve. This discussion included topics like:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Noise pollution
	\item Navigation using echolocation
	\item Re-usability of heat waste
	\item Mapping unknown terrains without any external technologies
	\item Maze navigation
\end{itemize}

After the brainstorming session, we decided on the problem we would like to work on the most, by voting, and started to break it down further more.
