    gas giants
        helium is important
    earthlike
        earthlike planets are often composed of silicate and metals.

    Tracks/wheels
        tracks are heavier than wheels, but better for rough terrain


Resources
For the purpose of exploration and resource gathering, planets can be split into two categories. The gassy giants, and the earthlike/rocky planets[ref?].
There is very little reason to explore a gassy giant, as they smoothly transition between gas, lquid, and solid the deeper you look[citation needed]. This means that it is extremely difficult to colosize such a planet, or build anything on it for that matter. However, they(solar system) have a relatively high helium content, which is a valuable gas for research[ref?]. 
In the other hand, earthlike planets have a larger variety of resources, and it is easier to build on them. These planets are often composed largely of metals and silicon[citation needed], which is what gives them their rocky and sandy surface.
