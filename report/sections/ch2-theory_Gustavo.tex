\section{Sensors}
In order to get data about forgein environments, sensors are necessary.

\subsection{Image Based}
Image based sensors are usually just simple cameras. The pictures the sensor takes, must be mathematically processed to yield any useful data.
%TODO: I don't know anything about image sensors
\subsection{Rangefinder}
A rangefinder is a device that measures the distance between itself, and a point some distance away from it. Rangefinders work based on the principle that the speed of an object is defined to be distance traveled over time traveled, which means that distance traveled is the speed of an object times the amount of time it traveled. To put this in math terms: \{v=d/t\} or \{d=t*v\}. Most rangefinders work on either sound or light. Both sound and light based rangefinders work by emitting a pulse in a specific direction, and counting how long it takes for the pulse to come back. Since the pulse has traveled back and forth, the distance is calculated as \(1/2*v*t\), where \(v\) is the speed of the pulse, and \(t\) is the time between the emission and the detection. This requires the rangefinder to know what the speed of the pulse is, meaning it has the be measured. It also means that in situations where the speed of the pulse varies, this equipment is either not useful, or has to be much more complicated. The main cause for a pulse to travel slower than expected is in situations where the environment the sensor is in varies in density, which can be caused by a variation in tempereature\cite{refraction}.
%TODO: (Image?)
An issue that affects both light and sound based rangefinders is refraction. Refraction is a phenomenon that occurs when a wave switches between mediums where it travels at different speeds. This change in mediums causes the wave to change it's direction. cite{snell:Wolf, K. B. (1995), "Geometry and dynamics in refracting systems", European Journal of Physics 16: 14â€“20.} Refraction would cause rangefinders to become effectively blind, as neither their direction nor the length measured can be trusted.

Light based rangefinders are slightly affected by the density of the medium they travel in. In earth-like atmospheres, this effect is nearly negligible, as light only travels 0.03\% slower in air when compared to the vacuum.\cite{refraction}.

Sound is also affected by the density of the medium it travels in, however, much more than when compared to light\cite{speedOfSound}.

\subsection{Pressure Based}
Pressure based sensors work by simply measuring how much pressure there is in a point in space. They can be used to measure the vertical distance between two points in a planet with an atmosphere\cite{barometric1}\cite{barometric2}.
