While running testing outside in areas with distances longer than 40 m the laser outputted a measurement of 255 cm. The reason behind this is that if the laser does not get a signal back it prints a error message with the integer 255. If that is not dealt with in the code the $/$scan topic will output a measurement of 2.55 m. We included a if statement that write 0 if a message with 255 is received.
