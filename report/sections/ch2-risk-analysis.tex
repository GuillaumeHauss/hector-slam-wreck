\section{Risk management}
Possible risks that could occur before, during and after the implementation of the proposed 2D mapping system, elaborated in this report, and presented in the form of a table together with a mitigation plan for each and every identified risk.

We listed most of the risks that would influence the design process of our product. These risks will be used as criteria for the end-product.

Risks are considered on two different scales with 4 levels. As the legend under the table shows, it starts from Very High (VH) being the most severe to Low (L), which can be considered as a minor issue. The two scales are \textbf{Probability}, which represents the chance of occurrence, and \textbf{Impact}, which represents the severity of the risk in case it would actually appear.

\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{tabular}{ | p{4.5cm} | l | l | p{5cm} |}
		\hline
		\bfseries Risk factor & \bfseries Probability & \bfseries Impact & \bfseries Mitigation strategy \\ \hline
		Going over the budget & M & VL & Carefully select the products and make sure we order the same models as specified in the excursion request form \\ \hline
		Parts not arriving in time & L & VH & Estimate a 2 week delivery time for each package\\ \hline
		Short-circuiting electronics during development & VL & H & Buy a new one or consider replacing it with similar hardware.\\ \hline
		Lack of knowledge about ROS & M & H & Find and compile a list of contact persons with knowledge about it and time to support us\\ \hline
		Compatibility issues or lack of support for hardware & L & VH & Research before ordering/selecting parts; otherwise replace \\ \hline
		Too big of a scope and too little time to complete & H & H & Cut down on scope and write a solid argument in the discussion about it \\
