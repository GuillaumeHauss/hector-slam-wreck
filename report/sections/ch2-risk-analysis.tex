\section{Risk management}
Possible risks that could occur before, during and after the implementation of the proposed %TODO: Insert prototype system name here
, elaborated in this report, and presented in the form of a table together with a mitigation plan for each and every identified risk.

\subsection{Overview} 
We listed most of the risks that would influence the design process of our product. These risks will be used as criteria for the end-product.

Risks are considered on two different scales with 4 levels. As the legend under the table shows, it starts from Very High (VH) being the most severe to Low (L), which can be considered as a minor issue. The two scales are \textbf{Probability}, which represents the chance of occurrence, and \textbf{Impact}, which represents the severity of the risk in case it would actually appear.
