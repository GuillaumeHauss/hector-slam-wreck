%\chapter(LaTeX)

One of the main reasons we chose to use \LaTeX\ was because of version control. Using Word or something similar sets some unavoidable limitations when it comes to doing research and writing a report. 
Another great benefit with using \LaTeX\ in our group is the OS Independence, in our group of 5 members there is 3 different operating systems.

Improvement suggestions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item More exercises
	\item More challenges
	\item Clarity on the steep learning curve and why it's worth transitioning
\end{itemize}

Areas of which we still feel uncomfortable:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Creating templates
	\item Manipulating with the AAU template
\end{enumerate}

The strong points of \LaTeX:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The ability to use version control (git/SVN)
	\item Packages
	\item Customizability
	\item Open-source and OS-independent
\end{itemize}

The weak points of \LaTeX:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The syntax is too verbose
	\item Hard to debug errors
	\item Differences in IDE capabilities on different platforms.
\end{itemize}
