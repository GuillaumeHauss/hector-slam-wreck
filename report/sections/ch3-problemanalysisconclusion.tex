\section{Conclusion of Problem Analysis}

During the research for this project, we have decided on what technologies we will use for solving the problem stated in the W-diagram.

We will use a rover with multiple sensors to navigate around. This rover will produce a 2D map of its surroundings, with the possibility of implementing equipment for 3D mapping. We will use both sound and light sensors for navigation and mapping. Ultrasonic-sensors will be used for close encounter maneuvers for their high precision at a close range (up to 4m)\cite{ultra}. For mapping we will be using a laser sensor, that will either automatically turn 360$^{\circ}$  or we will implement a motor to rotate the sensor.

The rover will both be remote controlled and autonomous for navigation. For reference points we will use the ultrasonic-sensors. %Is this still accurate?

The control computer will be a Raspberry Pi running a Debian Linux operating system. The reason for using the Raspberry Pi is that it can multi-task, read many sensors at the same time and build the 2D map on the go. Whereas for other microcontrollers, like the Arduino, we would only be able to collect data and need to build the map from it later, using another computer.

This picture shows how the flowchart from chapter one was expanded. We decided to focus on rovers, and extended the prototype requirements accordingly.
